    Signal
        Signal is where the data are stored. For example temperature data.

    Item 
        An item can be created from one or more signals and it has more metadata than a signal. For example from the temperature signal you can create two items: 
        one that has the temperature in Fahrenheit and one which has the temperature in celsius units.

    Metadata 
        Metadata is where you can put information about the signal or the item.
