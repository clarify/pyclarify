    Signal
        Signal is where the data are stored. For example temperature data.

    Item 
        An item can be created from one or more signals and it has more metadata than a signal. For example from the temperature signal you can create two items: 
        one that has the temperature in Fahrenheit and one which has the temperature in celsius units.

    Metadata 
        Metadata is where you can put information abouy the signal or the item. 
        In the current version you can add or update the metadata of the signal usign the PyClarify package. 
        To add or update metadata of the item you have to go to the Clarify website.
